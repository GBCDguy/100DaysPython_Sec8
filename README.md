Day 8:
Today's Progress:
Today, I worked on various Python functions to build more complex projects, including a Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text, a life expectancy calculator, a love calculator, and personalized greeting functions. I explored passing arguments to functions, returning values, and using loops to manipulate strings.

What I Learned:

Defining Functions with Parameters: Practiced defining functions that accept inputs, including multiple parameters, to create dynamic outputs.
String Manipulation: Used string manipulation techniques in the Caesar Cipher project to shift characters in the alphabet.
Loops within Functions: Implemented loops inside functions to calculate love scores and encrypt text by shifting the characters.
Conditional Logic: Used conditionals to handle user input and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt text based on the Caesar Cipher project.
Return Values: In the life_in_weeks function, I practiced returning values to be used elsewhere in the program.
Challenges:
Handling special characters and spaces in the Caesar Cipher was a challenge, as they needed to be skipped while still performing the shift on the letters.

Thoughts:
Today was a productive day of function exploration and string manipulation. The Caesar Cipher project was especially interesting because it gave me a good opportunity to work with both string indexing and control flow. Iâ€™m excited to dive into more encryption techniques and projects that require more complex logic.
